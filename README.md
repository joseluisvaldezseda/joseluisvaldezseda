# Hi there, I'm Jose Luis Valdez 👋 
**Data Scientist | AI & MLOps Specialist | Physicist & Process Engineer**

Data Scientist with over 3 years of experience implementing predictive models and ETL pipelines. Currently focused on driving ROI through predictive modeling and cloud architecture (Azure/Databricks). My background in Physics and Process Engineering allows me to bridge the gap between complex mathematical modeling and operational business needs.

### 🚀 Quick Summary

- 🔭 **I’m currently working on**: Lead forecasting models and credit offer recommendations for **PepsiCo** (via DXC), optimizing credit allocation and reducing default rates using **PySpark and Databricks**.
- 🌱 **I’m currently learning**: Advanced **Transformers & LLMs** (following Stanford's CME 295), Agentic workflows (RAG), and building production-ready apps with **Databricks Apps**.
- 👯 **I’m looking to collaborate on**: Open-source MLOps tools or projects that involve complex mathematical modeling applied to industrial or business processes.
- 🤔 **I’m looking for help with**: Deepening my knowledge in **LLM-as-a-judge** evaluation techniques and optimizing inference for Large Language Models.
- 💬 **Ask me about**: Data Science, MLOps, **Power BI**, SQL optimization, and how quantum particles behave in accelerating potentials (yes, I have a paper on that!).
